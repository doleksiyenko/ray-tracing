# An exploration into Ray Tracing and Computer Shaders in Unity!

## What is ray tracing?

Ray tracing is a method for rendering images, based on the physical behaviour of light. Using this method to generate images has the advantage of realistic reflections, refraction, and shadows, in addition to a variety of other optical effects.

## What is a compute shader?

A compute shader is a program that runs on the GPU. The GPU is useful for running algorithms that are parallel, where a benefit can be gained from running simultaneous computations.

## HLSL

HLSL (High-level shader language) is a C-like language developed by Microsoft that is used to program shaders in DirectX.
